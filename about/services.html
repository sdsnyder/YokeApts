            <p> 
                Yoke Apartments offers variety of preventative, routine, and requested maintenance services to our residents. 
                We know that needing maintenance work done in your apartment is not the ideal situation, so to make our residents' lives 
                easier, we created an online maintenance request system. This system guarantees that residents receive a response to their
                requests within 24 hours. 
            </p>
            
            <p> 
                Current residents should create and account on our website by going to the Account Services tab. After creating an account, 
                residents can visit the Service Center tab to submit a maintenance request ticket. If you are not satisfied with how we handled 
                your request, you may file a complaint by visiting the Complaints tab and your situation will be reviewed and addressed.
