                Yoke Apartments was built in the year of 2017 with the goal of providing affordable, but comfortable
			    off-campus housing for students attending the University of Maryland, Baltimore County and the Community College 
			    of Baltimore County, Catonsville. Our apartments are less than a 5 minute drive from both the UMBC and CCBC 
			    Catonsville campuses so students are close to their school, but are able toexperience living on their own.
            </p>	
		    <p> 
                Our apartment complex was designed with a modern and simple style in mind. We have luxury studio apartments 
			    with lots of open space and natural lighting.
			    Our amenities include an outdoor swimming pool, firepits, common areas, media rooms, and a fitness center. 
			    We also have covered parking spaces and guest parking available. 
            </p>
		    <p> 
                If you are a current resident of Yoke Apartments, THANK YOU for choosing us!
			    If you would like to know more about our apartments, contact us by calling 443-555-1234 or emailing
